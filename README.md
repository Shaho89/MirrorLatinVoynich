## 📘 Project Overview
This repository presents an independent research hypothesis suggesting that the **Voynich Manuscript** encodes a **Late Roman medical treatise** written in a *mirror-oriented Latin cipher* from the 15th century.

The study combines **historical linguistics**, **cryptography**, and **AI-based analysis** to reconstruct possible phonetic and morphological structures behind the mysterious text.

## 🧠 Core Concept — Mirror-Latin
**Mirror-Latin** refers to a horizontally reflected form of Latin with phonetic substitutions and symbolic compression.  
Such methods may have been used to conceal restricted scientific knowledge, similar to mirror-writing techniques known from Leonardo da Vinci and other Renaissance scholars.

## ⚙️ AI Decoding Specification
The project includes:
- Encoding tables and pseudocode for AI interpretation  
- Example transformation:  
  `okeedy qokedy → ydek oq ydeko → deco quid deco` → *“I prepare what I prepare”*  
- Stepwise mapping for graphemic normalization and lemmatization
